### What I learned

In progress of learning a naming convention called BEM for classes in HTML and CSS.

### Continued development

What to get confortable with useing one naming convection and then to experiment with others(SMACSS, OOCSS). Striving to think in a systems, not pages, so I can easily reuse styles throughout the project.

### Useful resources
